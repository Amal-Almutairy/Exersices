## Introduction to Machine Learning Exercises

# 1- Identify four real-life applications of supervised and unsupervised problems.
1- Supervised Learning:
  
  is like learning with a teacher
training dataset is like a teacher
the training dataset is used to train the machine
Example:
  
- Classification: Machine is trained to classify something into some class.

classifying whether a patient has disease or not
classifying whether an email is spam or not
Regression: Machine is trained to predict some value like price, weight or height.

predicting house/property price
predicting stock market price

2- Unsupervised Learning:
is like learning without a teacher
the machine learns through observation & find structures in data

Example:
- Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data

such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior
Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data

such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y

# - Explain what makes these problems supervised versus unsupervised.
1- Supervised  
- Classification problem. 
Classification problems most commonly revolve around predicting a binary or multinomial response measure.
such as:
  Did a customer redeem a coupon (coded as yes/no or 1/0)?
  
- Regression problem  
Regression problems revolve around predicting output that falls on a continuum. In the examples above, predicting home sales prices and time to market reflect a regression problem because the output is numeric and continuous. 
This means, given the combination of predictor values, the response value could fall anywhere along some continuous spectrum 
  
# - For each problem identify the target variable (if applicable) and potential features.
Classification problem target is a binary or multinomial response.
Regression problems target is real value Depending on the combination of two features.

# 2- Identify and contrast a regression problem with a classification problem.
1-
- Classification is the task of predicting a discrete class label.
- Regression is the task of predicting a continuous quantity.
2-
There is some overlap between the algorithms for classification and regression; 
for example:
A classification algorithm may predict a continuous value, 
but the continuous value is in the form of a probability for a class label.
A regression algorithm may predict a discrete value,
but the discrete value in the form of an integer quantity.
3- 
evaluate classification and regression predictions varies 'do not overlap'
, for example:
  
- Classification predictions can be evaluated using accuracy, 
whereas regression predictions cannot.
- Regression predictions can be evaluated using root mean squared error, 
whereas classification predictions cannot.

# - What is the target variable in each problem 

#   and why would being able to accurately predict this target be beneficial to society?
# -   What are potential features and where could you collect this information?
# -   What is determining if the problem is a regression or a classification problem?


# 3- Identify three open source datasets suitable for machine learning (e.g., https://bit.ly/35wKu5c).
# - Explain the type of machine learning models that could be constructed from the data (e.g., supervised versus unsupervised and regression versus classification).
# - What are the dimensions of the data?
# - Is there a code book that explains who collected the data, why it was originally collected, and what each variable represents?
# - If the dataset is suitable for supervised learning, which variable(s) could be considered as a useful target? Which variable(s) could be considered as features?



# 4- Identify examples of misuse of machine learning in society. What was the ethical concern?
